## About the Video Course
Azure Storage is a cloud solution for data services on Azure. Developers work with many types of data: unstructured, structured, real-time, and rarely accessed. Azure Storage is a highly scalable, highly secure PaaS that offers capabilities for blob-, table-, queue-, and file-based storage. It is a powerful and flexible cloud-based storage system and service that can store seemingly limitless amounts of data for any duration of time.

In this course, we delve into the capabilities of the Azure Storage APIs and learn how to use the Azure Storage SDK to design .NET applications. Along the way, we also cover the introductory concepts for each service, as well as third-party tools for managing Azure Storage. 

We would cover Azure Storage basics, as well as advanced topics such as the Azure Storage SDK for the development of applications. You also get security, performance, and other tips. 

By the end of the course, you'll know much more about how to use Azure Storage to build custom solutions that are optimized to meet the unique needs of your applications.
